# ARM_Cortex_M_leds1
This is a very good course!
ARM Cortex-M Bare-Metal Embedded-C Programming | Udemy

This is for people that, like me, use an STM32F4 Discovery or Discovery F4 board, when doing this course.
All works! Note it uses STM32F407VG MCU and a different assignment for the board LEDs.
I installed a pack (STMicroelectronics STM32F4 Series) for this, and use STM32F407VGTx, ST-Link Debugger, and ST-LINK/V2 to flash the board.
